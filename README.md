# DeepLearningWithFastai
These are my fastai 2018 course's notebook from Google Colab

### Lesson 1 Notebook
Using pretrained models for classifying dogs and cats.
Notebook is [here](https://github.com/neelkamalsb/DeepLearningWithFastai/blob/master/Lesson1FULL%20(1).ipynb)
  
### Dog Breeds Challenge
Applying things learnt in Lesson 1 and checking results with different architectures.

| Architecture        | Accuracy          | Link to notebook  |
